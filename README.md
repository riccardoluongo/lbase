all this is is a learning project i made to learn basic networking and storage engine algorithms in C.
It aims to implement a simple key/value store with an in-memory cache that communicates through a TCP/IP socket with a cli client.
The client aims to be simple and easy to embed in scripts, as per the Unix philosophy.

Sometime in the future I plan on cleaning up the extremely ugly code and add multi-threading and performance enhancements :)
